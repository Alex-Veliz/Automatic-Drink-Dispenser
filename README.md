This is everything that I did for my Automatic Drink Dispenser project
Included in "App_print" is the Arduino sketch that I developed for connecting an HC-06 Bluetooth Module, 10 servo motors, and 4 lasers.
VarSpeedServo.zip is a library used to control the speed of the servo motors.
The screen shots Bellow are demonstations of what the app looks like when used.
